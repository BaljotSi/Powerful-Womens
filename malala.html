    <p>Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani education advocate who, at the age of 17 in 2014, became the youngest person to
        win the Nobel Peace Prize after surviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban. Yousafzai became an advocate
        for girls' education when she herself was still a child, which resulted in the Taliban issuing a death threat
        against her.Malala Yousafzai (Pashto pronunciation: Pashto: ملاله یوسفزۍ [məlalə jusəf zəj],[4] Urdu: ملالہ
        یوسفزئی; born 12 July 1997), often referred to mononymously as Malala, and by her married name Malala Yousafzai
        Malik is a Pakistani activist for female education and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. She is also the world's
        youngest Nobel Prize laureate, and second Pakistani to ever receive a Nobel Prize. She is known for human rights
        advocacy, especially the education of women and children in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
        northwest Pakistan, where the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan had at times banned girls from attending school. Her
        advocacy has grown into an international movement, and according to former Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid
        Khaqan Abbasi, she has become the country's "most prominent citizen".</p>

    <p> The daughter of educational activist Ziauddin Yousafzai was born to a Pashtun family in Mingora, Khyber
        Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Her family came to run a chain of schools in the region. Considering Muhammad Ali Jinnah
        and Benazir Bhutto as her role models, she was particularly inspired by her father's thoughts and humanitarian
        work. In early 2009, when she was 1112, she wrote a blog under a pseudonym for the BBC Urdu detailing her life
        during the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan's occupation of Swat. The following summer, journalist Adam B. Ellick made
        a New York Times documentary about her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region. She rose in
        prominence, giving interviews in print and on television, and she was nominated for the International Children's
        Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu.</p>

    <p> On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in the Swat District, after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were
        shot by a Tehrik-i Taliban Pakistan gunman in an assassination attempt in retaliation for her activism; the
        gunman fled the scene. Yousafzai was hit in the head with a bullet and remained unconscious and in critical
        condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, but her condition later improved enough for her to be
        transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK. The attempt on her life sparked an international
        outpouring of support for her. Deutsche Welle reported in January 2013 that she may have become "the most famous
        teenager in the world". Weeks after the attempted murder, a group of 50 leading Muslim clerics in Pakistan
        issued a fatwā against those who tried to kill her. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan were internationally denounced by
        governments, human rights organizations and feminist groups. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan officials responded to
        condemnation by further denouncing Yousafzai, indicating plans for a possible second assassination attempt,
        which they felt was justified as a religious obligation. Their statements resulted in further international
        condemnation.</p>

    <p> After her recovery, Yousafzai became a prominent activist for the right to education. Based in Birmingham, she
        co-founded the Malala Fund, a non-profit organisation, with Shiza Shahid.[13] In 2013, she co-authored I Am
        Malala, an international best seller. In 2012, she received Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize and the
        2013 Sakharov Prize. In 2014, she was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, with Kailash Satyarthi of
        India. Aged 17 at the time, she was the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate. In 2015, she was the subject of the
        Oscar-shortlisted documentary He Named Me Malala. The 2013, 2014 and 2015 issues of Time magazine featured her
        as one of the most influential people globally. In 2017 she was awarded honorary Canadian citizenship and became
        the youngest person to address the House of Commons of Canada.</p>

    <p>Yousafzai completed her secondary school education at Edgbaston High School, Birmingham in England from 2013 to
        2017. From there she won a place at Oxford University and undertook three years of study for a Bachelor of Arts
        degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE), as an undergraduate at Lady Margaret Hall, a college of the
        university. She graduated in 2020.</p>
